- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm test` to run tests in the rooster-new directory

## Migration Strategy Notes

- **Incremental Approach**: The rooster-new folder provides a solid foundation to build upon
- **Reference Original Code**: Use the original src/ folder as reference for functionality
- **Modern Patterns**: Prioritize modern Angular patterns over maintaining legacy code structure
- **Testing First**: Fix test files first to ensure proper validation during migration
- **Performance Focus**: Leverage Angular 20's performance features throughout the migration
