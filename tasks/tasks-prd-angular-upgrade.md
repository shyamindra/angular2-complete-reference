## Migration Strategy Notes

- **Incremental Approach**: The rooster-new folder provides a solid foundation to build upon
- **Reference Original Code**: Use the original src/ folder as reference for functionality
- **Modern Patterns**: Prioritize modern Angular patterns over maintaining legacy code structure
- **Testing First**: Fix test files first to ensure proper validation during migration
- **Performance Focus**: Leverage Angular 20's performance features throughout the migration

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Configure Test Environment**: Set up Chrome browser for test execution
2. **Complete Component Implementation**: Add any missing implementation details
3. **Implement Modern Features**: Add signals, OnPush change detection, and performance optimizations
4. **Modal/Notification Systems**: Replace TODO comments with modern implementations
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all user flows and edge cases
6. **Documentation**: Update README and create migration documentation
7. **Deployment**: Prepare production deployment configuration
