# Product Requirements Document: Angular Upgrade to Latest Version

## Introduction/Overview

The Rooster application is currently running on Angular 7.2.0, which was released in 2019 and is significantly outdated. This upgrade will modernize the codebase to the latest Angular version (Angular 18), enabling improved performance, security, developer experience, and access to modern Angular features. The upgrade will also ensure the application remains maintainable and follows current best practices.

**Problem**: The application is running on an outdated Angular version that lacks security updates, performance improvements, and modern development features.

**Goal**: Successfully upgrade the Angular application to the latest stable version while maintaining all existing functionality and improving overall application quality.

## Goals

1. **Upgrade Angular Core**: Migrate from Angular 7.2.0 to Angular 18 (latest stable version)
2. **Update Dependencies**: Update all Angular-related dependencies to compatible versions
3. **Modernize Codebase**: Implement current Angular best practices and patterns
4. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure all existing features work correctly after upgrade
5. **Improve Testing**: Enhance test coverage and modernize testing approach
6. **Performance Optimization**: Leverage new Angular features for better performance
7. **Developer Experience**: Improve build times, development workflow, and tooling

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to use the latest Angular features and tooling so that I can write more efficient and maintainable code.

2. **As a user**, I want the application to load faster and be more responsive so that I can complete my tasks more efficiently.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want the application to have the latest security updates so that the system remains secure and compliant.

4. **As a QA engineer**, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently verify application functionality.

5. **As a product manager**, I want the application to be future-proof so that we can easily add new features and maintain the codebase.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Angular Core Upgrade**: The system must upgrade all Angular core packages (@angular/core, @angular/common, @angular/compiler, etc.) to version 18.x.

2. **Dependency Updates**: The system must update all Angular-related dependencies to versions compatible with Angular 18.

3. **Build System Modernization**: The system must update the Angular CLI and build tools to the latest versions.

4. **TypeScript Upgrade**: The system must upgrade TypeScript to version 5.x (required for Angular 18).

5. **Code Migration**: The system must migrate deprecated Angular patterns and syntax to current standards.

6. **Testing Framework Updates**: The system must update testing frameworks (Jasmine, Karma) to latest compatible versions.

7. **Linting and Code Quality**: The system must update linting rules and code quality tools to current standards.

8. **Performance Optimization**: The system must implement Angular 18 performance features (standalone components, signals, etc.).

9. **Error Handling**: The system must maintain or improve error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

10. **Documentation**: The system must update documentation to reflect the new Angular version and patterns.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **UI/UX Redesign**: This upgrade will not include visual design changes or UI improvements beyond what's required for compatibility.

2. **New Feature Development**: No new features will be added during this upgrade process.

3. **Database Schema Changes**: No changes to data models or database structure.

4. **Third-party Service Integration**: No new external service integrations beyond what's required for the upgrade.

5. **Mobile App Development**: This upgrade focuses only on the web application.

## Design Considerations

- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure the upgrade doesn't break existing user workflows
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement new Angular features gradually where beneficial
- **Responsive Design**: Maintain existing responsive design patterns
- **Accessibility**: Preserve and enhance accessibility features
- **Performance**: Leverage Angular 18's performance improvements (standalone components, signals, etc.)

## Technical Considerations

- **Migration Path**: Follow Angular's official migration guide from 7.x to 18.x
- **Breaking Changes**: Address all breaking changes between Angular versions
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolve any dependency version conflicts
- **Build Optimization**: Implement modern build optimizations (tree-shaking, lazy loading)
- **Testing Strategy**: Maintain existing test coverage while modernizing test patterns
- **Deployment**: Ensure smooth deployment process with rollback capability

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Success**: All existing features work correctly after upgrade
2. **Performance Improvement**: Application load time improves by at least 20%
3. **Build Time**: Development build time improves by at least 30%
4. **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve current test coverage (currently 26 spec files)
5. **Error Reduction**: Reduce runtime errors by leveraging Angular 18's improved error handling
6. **Security**: All security vulnerabilities from outdated dependencies are resolved
7. **Developer Productivity**: Development workflow improvements measurable through faster iteration cycles

## Open Questions

1. **Specific Angular 18 Features**: Which specific Angular 18 features should be prioritized for implementation?
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: What are the current performance baselines to measure improvements against?
3. **Rollback Strategy**: What is the preferred rollback strategy if issues arise during deployment?
4. **Team Training**: Do team members need training on new Angular 18 features and patterns?
5. **Third-party Library Compatibility**: Are there any critical third-party libraries that may not be compatible with Angular 18?

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Breaking changes in Angular APIs between versions 7 and 18
- **Medium Risk**: Third-party library compatibility issues
- **Low Risk**: Build system configuration changes
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, gradual migration, and rollback procedures
